# Econometrics Analysis Project (2024-2025)

This repository contains the analysis and code for the Econometrics Project led by Prof. Patrick Waelbroeck, focusing on both cross-sectional and time-series data. 

## Key Objectives

### Part 1: Cross-Section Data
- Hypothesis testing for OLS estimators and identification of biases (sample selection, omitted variable, multicollinearity).
- Regression analysis and variable transformation with Boston housing price data (`HPRICE2.RAW`).
- Categorization, visualization, and statistical interpretation of key variables.

### Part 2: Heteroskedasticity
- Diagnostic tests for heteroskedasticity.
- Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression to address heteroskedasticity issues.

### Part 3: Time Series Data
- Stationarity and autocorrelation analysis for economic indicators (GDP, unemployment, inflation).
- Hypothesis testing for Granger causality and structural breakpoints.
- Implementation of GLS corrections for autocorrelation.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, along with detailed documentation for reproducibility.
